Angel SDK
=========

Angel SDK provides access to digital health devices using Bluetooth Low Energy profiles. 
The SDK is designed for use with Angel health sensor, currently under development by 
Seraphim Sense Ltd. Angel will allow monitoring of heart rate, blood oxygen, temperature, 
and activity. Developers will be able to access these health metrics, and other features, 
in order to create new digital health apps. The SDK is planned for support of Android 
and iOS devices.
